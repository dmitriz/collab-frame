# Project Setup Checklist

Use this when creating a new GitHub repository intended for clear collaboration, automation, and assistant integration.

## Initial Setup
- [] Select a `.gitignore` template (e.g. Node, Python, etc.)
- [] Do NOT auto-generate README.md (this will be supplied by Collab Frame)
- [] Do NOT add license file unless explicitly needed

## Repository Settings
- [] Enable “Delete branch after merge” in Settings ✅
- [] Enable discussions (optional) if community input is expected
- [] Disable wikis unless you use them intentionally

## Optional Enhancements
- [] Create placeholder README ONLY if needed to initialize repo
- [] Include README link to your Collab Stack
- [] Create `plan-now.md` to define first block

> This checklist keeps project setup intentional, repeatable, and resilient.
