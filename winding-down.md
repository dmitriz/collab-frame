# Winding Down Checklist

Use this when you feel your session is getting too long, or you’re losing momentum/clarity, but don’t want to abandon your work.

## Step Back
1. Stop typing for 1 minute.
2. Ask: What have I actually produced so far? (Not what I thought about)
3. Write a 2-sentence summary of what you just accomplished.

## Triage Next Actions
4. Capture 1–3 next actions as bullet points (for next time)
5. Flag anything that needs delegation, or could be postponed

## Close Loop
6. Commit or save all open files
7. Leave a note in `plan-now.md` (or your preferred planning document) about what you'll do next
8. Close the tab. Walk away. Session done, intentionally.

> The goal isn’t to stop working — it’s to build trust that you can stop and pick back up smoothly.
