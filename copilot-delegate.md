# Copilot Delegate Queue

Use this file to queue small automation tasks for GitHub Copilot or your preferred assistant.
It keeps delegation clear, frictionless, and separate from planning or vision work.

## Queued Tasks
- [ ] Install Notion API script to capture database IDs
- [ ] Create a README template for new tool scripts
- [ ] Convert all `plan-now.md` timestamps to ISO format

## Instructions for Copilot
- Use `scripts/` folder as output target
- Push all failures to `scripts/debug/` as `example-error.txt` variant
- Do not edit `vision.md` or `collab-brief.md` directly

> Append new tasks as checkbox items only. Keep actionable, not vague ideas
