# Trigger Index

A central list of all behavioral and delegation triggers across this system.
Use it to recenter, recover, or delegate at any point.

To use a trigger, reference its filename in your instructions or load the file directly when needed.

## Behavioral Cues
- `reset-ritual.md` – use when drifting, lost, or scattered
- `winding-down.md` – use when nearing exit, wanting clean pause
- `focus-cue.md` – recenter before task
- `exit-cue.md` – clean handoff or state save

## Operational Delegates
- `copilot-delegate.md` – task queue for automation
- `copilot-errors.md` – track failures and manual patches
- `feedback.md` – log reviewer notes or reflections

> Update this file only when new core behavioral or operational files are added
