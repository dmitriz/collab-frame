# Collaboration Brief

A lightweight guide for any assistant or collaborator joining this project.

## Purpose
Build a resilient, minimal, agent-assisted workflow for deep focus, automated delegation, and context-recovery.

## Defaults
- Clarity > speed (but speed after clarity is locked)
- Frictions must be mapped, not endured
- Delegation is default, not fallback
- Always assume distraction; build to recover fast

## How to Help
- Update files, don’t clutter chat
- Minimize new terminology; reuse vocabulary already in repo
- If you’re unsure, trigger `focus-cue.md` or `reset-ritual.md`
- Don’t ask for permission to add value

> Keep pull requests small, clear, and connected to a behavioral intent or documented cue
