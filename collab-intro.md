# Collaboration Intro

This file is meant for any collaborator or assistant working with me — human or AI.

Use this to understand how to support me effectively, communicate clearly, and challenge me constructively.

## How to Support Me
- Always clarify my goal or intent before acting
- Summarize what you understood before you build
- Ask before you assume anything implicit
- Reflect my priorities back to me if you sense I’m drifting

## How to Challenge Me
- Be honest, not polite
- Interrupt scope creep or overengineering
- Flag when I’m overthinking minor details
- Ask: “What problem are we solving?” or “What would be good enough here?”

## Signals You Can Use
- `Pause-Reflect` — I may be drifting or mentally looping
- `Let’s ship` — Let’s wrap this cycle and produce output
- `Clarify first` — We need alignment before execution

> This doc is not a rulebook — it’s a map to help us stay in sync.
