# Session Checkpoint

Use this midway through a deep work session, especially if you’ve been working for 45–60 minutes and feel energized but unsure whether to continue.

## Check Your Trajectory
- Am I still moving intentionally, or just refining?
- Is the impact of this time increasing, steady, or declining?
- Is this joyful focus or resistance to switching context?
- Will 15 more minutes lead to completion, or just expansion?

## Then Decide
- **Continue**: Add 15–30 minutes of focused work with a defined target
- **Wind Down**: Shift to `winding-down.md` and close loop
- **Fork the Task**: Capture idea or intent in `plan-now.md` (create if needed) and reschedule

> This lets you extend flow without breaking trust in your own boundaries.
