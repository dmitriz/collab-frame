# Reset Ritual — Reboot Your Focus

Use this file when you:
- Feel scattered or mentally overheated
- Aren’t sure what you’re trying to accomplish
- Have been refining or exploring for too long

## Quick Reset Checklist
1. Pause for 30 seconds. No typing. Close eyes if helpful.
2. Ask yourself:
   “What am I trying to solve?”
   “What would success look like 15 minutes from now?”
3. Write down one intentional action to start next.
4. Remove any tabs/windows not needed for that one action.
5. Resume with clear intent and small scope.

## Bonus: Reboot Modes
If you need a deeper reset, choose one of these frames:
- **Design mode**: I am thinking about structure and purpose
- **Flow mode**: I am executing defined tasks rapidly
- **Meta mode**: I am debugging my process or tools

> Say the mode to yourself before you begin. This builds intentionality into your workflow.
