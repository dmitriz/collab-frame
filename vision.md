# Vision

Resilient collaboration and mental workflow design with minimal effort, high reuse, and no decision fatigue.

## What We Are Building
- An operating system for thinking clearly with agents
- A pattern library for focus, context switching, and automation
- A resilience stack for working in messy real life conditions

## Not The Goal
- Perfection on first try
- Frictionless tools that assume discipline (we donâ€™t)
- Rigid hierarchies or overspecified structure

## What We Care About
- Context survival over time
- Ease of re-entry after distraction
- Delegation that works without burnout
