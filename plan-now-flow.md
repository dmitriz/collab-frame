# Execution Flow Block

Use this for 20m focus blocks with zero context switching.

Start
---
1. Open `copilot-delegate.md`
2. Choose the first unchecked task
3. Run `focus-cue.md` to lock intent
4. Work until the timer ends
5. Use `exit-cue.md` to cleanly pause or handoff
6. Log result in `execution-log.md`

Constraints
---
- No editing old files
- No switching projects
- No chat rewriting

> Only one block at a time. Switching requires an exit ritual
