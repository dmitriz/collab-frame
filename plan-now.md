# Plan Now – 3-Day Window

**Start Date:** [Today’s date]  
**Focus Window:** 72 hours

## What We’re Building
A reproducible collaboration framework (“Collab Frame”) to support clarity, reflection, and intentional delegation — beginning with collaboration files and guidance for assistants.

## Immediate Goals
- Draft `about-me.md`, `plan-now.md`, and `intent.md`
- Finalize and commit an updated planning spec (`docs/modules.md`) for Copilot
- Run a winding-down review after 90 minutes of focused work

## Stretch Goal
- Begin `reset-ritual.md` and `winding-down.md`

## Daily Checkpoints
- **Day 1**: Complete planning files
- **Day 2**: Review and commit Copilot-ready planning spec
- **Day 3**: Evaluate what worked, what to change, and what to delegate

> Keep sessions short and focused. When excitement turns to drift, run `winding-down.md`.
