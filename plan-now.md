# Plan Now

Define short, single-task execution blocks to focus attention and ship fast.
Use only one block at a time.

Today
---
- [] Start 20m execution cycle
- [] Use `focus-cue.md` to lock intention
- [] Log result in `execution-log.md`

Execution Block
---
Intent: Complete first task in `copilot-delegate.md`
Duration: 20m focused (set external timer)
Environment: No notifications, no context switch

Flow
1. Open `copilot-delegate.md`
2. Pick first unchecked task
3. Run `focus-cue.md` to lock intent
4. Work until timer ends
5. Use `exit-cue.md` to pause or close
6. Log progress in `execution-log.md`

Constraints
---
- No editing vision
- No exploring tools
- No refactoring old notes

> Exit cleanly before switching tasks
