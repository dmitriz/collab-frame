# Plan Now – Live Working Block

**Start Date:** [Insert Today’s Date]
**Focus Window:** 3 days | 3 tasks | 3 hours

## Current Focus
Refactor and operationalize the Collab Frame documents

## Next 3 Tasks
1. Enable assistants to trigger ritual files at the right moment
2. Write usage examples or “runners” for each ritual file
3. Evaluate PR comments selectively (via Copilot) and close old branches

## Working Strategy
- Stay in flow by skipping manual labeling and long reviews
- Treat file creation as cheap, disposable iteration
- Only respond to review comments that add semantic clarity

## Mini Checkpoints
- At ~60 min, use `session-checkpoint.md`
- At end of block, use `winding-down.md`

> When in doubt, keep shipping. Clarity comes from doing, not thinking alone.
