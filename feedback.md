# Feedback & Reflection

Capture review notes, personal reflections, or feedback from assistants and tools.
This keeps learning separate from execution and reduces mental clutter.

## From Reviewers
- [ ] `triage_message` output schemas could use enums for type/priority
- [ ] Clarify `context` structure in `generate_solution` signature

## From You
- [] Resilience stack needs quick trigger index
- [] Script failures should auto-link to `copilot-errors.md`

## From Agents/Assistants
- [] `reset-ritual.md` was successfully used as reentry tool → promote to collab brief

> Only archive feedback once it’s acted on or declined explicitly
