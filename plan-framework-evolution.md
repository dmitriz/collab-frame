# Framework Evolution Plan

Clarifying, strengthening, and implementing the core design of this collaboration framework.

## What Makes It Different

- Intent-first: Every doc starts with why
- Invitations: Files encourage participation
- Separation: Intent, execution, reflection are modular
- Lightweight: Structure is minimal, reuse is easy

## Mindset Shift

- Ask before assume
- Reflect before act
- Clarity over rigid steps

Framework shapes behavior without hardcoding it.

## Planned Expansions

- [ ] Trigger examples in docs
- [ ] Reusable invitation phrases
- [ ] Short onboarding summary
- [ ] Memory reference structure
- [ ] Role-based feedback loop example
- [ ] Simple automation via GitHub

## Live Use Case

A human and assistant co-develop this framework
Roles are created on demand
Reflection is embedded in the process
Feedback loops guide structure and flow
This is collaboration in action, not just about it.
