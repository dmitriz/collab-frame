# About Me

This file captures my working style, collaboration preferences, and intentional defaults for working with assistants.

## Core Traits
- Minimalist with zero-tolerance for UI bloat
- Frictions are mapped and actively removed or delegated
- Delegation is default (not fallback)
- I opt for clarity over speed, but seek speed after clarity is locked
- High tolerance for looping, low tolerance for manual overhead

## Operating Principles
- All clarifying questions are answered via file updates, not chat
- System is designed to recover from forgetting, not punish it
- Trust assistant judgment to generate/update files without prompt
- Treat chat as a log of context, not a source of actionable state

> This file may update at any time without approval loop
