# About Me

## Who I Am
I approach systems and collaboration through a precision-oriented lens, with a strong mathematical mindset. I value clarity, minimalism, and structure over speed, though I respect the need to move fast when momentum is high.

## How I Think
I work in layers: defining meaning before structure, structure before process, and process before code. I aim to design resilient systems — ones that support delegation, long-term iteration, and reflective workflows.

## What I Value in Collaboration
- Shared understanding of purpose and constraints
- Explicit assumptions and definitions
- Minimal, clear artifacts
- Open critique without politeness filters
- A healthy balance between depth and momentum

## How You Can Help Me
- Interrupt scope creep or over-refinement
- Suggest “Pause-Reflect” when I’m drifting, blocked, or overthinking
- Push me to define what “done” means before starting
- Help me shift between high-level vision and immediate outputs

## Collaboration Mode Signals
- If I say: “Let’s slow down” → Move into clarification/reflection mode
- If I say: “Pause-Reflect” → Prompt me to wind down and refocus
- If I say: “Let’s ship” → Prioritize completing something small and concrete
