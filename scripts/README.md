# Session Scripts

Core scripts for planning, delegating, and exiting work sessions in the `collab-frame` system.

## Available Scripts

### `npm run plan-now`

Starts a 45â€“60 minute focus session. Logs metadata to stdout.

### `npm run delegate-task`

Simulates delegating a file or task to Copilot.

### `npm run exit-cue`

Ends a session and logs summary or time spent.

## Requirements

- Node.js v18+ installed
- Copilot or GPT-enabled workflows available for delegation hooks (optional)

## Dev Notes

These scripts are invoked manually or by Copilot. Logs are standard console output for now.
