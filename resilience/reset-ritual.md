# Reset Ritual

A quick mental macro to restore focus when you feel scattered, overstimulated, or in a drift loop.

## When to Run
- You feel overstimulated but can’t pause
- You open a tool and forget why
- You forgot what your last commit was

## 3-Step Reset
1. Name what you were doing before you got lost
2. Name what you need to do next (only one thing)
3. Run `plan-now.md` or `pause` explicitly

## If You’re Still Blocked
- Run the [winding-down.md](winding-down.md) sequence
- Push a [recovery-note.md](recovery-note.md) with context loss summary

> This is not motivational, it’s procedural resilience
