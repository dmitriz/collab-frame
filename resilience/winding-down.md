# Winding Down Sequence

Use this when you want to exit flow without crash or forgetting your context.

## When to Run
- Session is ending but you’re still in the zone
- You need to pause but you’re resisting

## Steps
1. Open `plan-now.md` and save unfinished state to `plan-now.md.bak`
2. Open `copilot-delegate.md` and queue next file
3. Optionally write a quick `recovery-note.md` with final state

## Reminder
Don’t process review comments or debug errors during winding down. Push them to next block
