# Focus Cue

A lightweight reminder to enter intentional flow.
Use before starting a block, after context switches, or when you notice wandering.

## What To Ask Yourself
- What am I trying to complete right now?
- What file should be open?
- Am I doing what future-me will thank me for?

## Micro-Trigger
_"This is my intent file."_
_"I'm executing, not configuring."_

> Rerun as often as needed. This is not a decision aid, it's a re-centering anchor.
