# Exit Cue

Use this when you need to stop, switch, or wind down without leaving context behind.

## What To Ask
- Did I update `plan-now.md` or push a recovery note?
- What did I leave unfinished? (Be specific, 1 line)
- Will I be able to re-enter this state in 2 clicks or less?

## If Not Ready To Exit
- Do 1 quick commit, queue next file, or push context to backup

> Run this cue manually before you get pulled into another thread
