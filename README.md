# Collab Frame

This repository is a modular system for resilient, reflective, and delegation-friendly collaboration — built to support both human and AI partners.

You can fork it, remix it, or use it as your personal collaboration stack.

## Core Documents
- `about-me.md` — how to support & challenge me
- `plan-now.md` — short-term focus window
- `intent.md` — why this system exists
- `vision.md` — longer-term ambitions

## Reflective Routines
- `reset-ritual.md` — to recover when scattered
- `winding-down.md` — to exit long deep work blocks intentionally
- `session-checkpoint.md` — mid-session course correction

## How to Use This Stack
1. Use `plan-now.md` to frame short cycles (3 days, 3 hours, or 3 tasks)
2. Run checkpoints (every ~60 min) to decide whether to continue or pivot
3. Use `winding-down.md` at the end of a deep session
4. Delegate tasks or reflections to assistants or tools

> The goal is not to follow a system perfectly, but to build trust in your ability to recover clarity, intention, and momentum.
