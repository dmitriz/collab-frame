## Overview

This repository is a modular system for resilient, reflective, and delegation-friendly collaboration — built to support both human and AI partners.

You can fork this framework, remix it, or use it as your personal collaboration stack.

## Core Documents

- [about-me.md](about-me.md) — How to support & challenge me effectively
- [plan-now.md](plan-now.md) — Short-term focus window for immediate priorities
- [vision.md](vision.md) — Longer-term ambitions and project direction
- [intent.md](intent.md) — Why this system exists and its guiding principles

## Reflective Routines

- [reset-ritual.md](resilience/reset-ritual.md) — To recover when scattered or losing focus
- [winding-down.md](resilience/winding-down.md) — To exit long deep work blocks intentionally
- [session-checkpoint.md](session-checkpoint.md) — Mid-session course correction techniques

## How to Use This Stack

1. Use [plan-now.md](plan-now.md) to frame short cycles (3 days, 3 hours, or 3 tasks)
2. Run checkpoints (every ~60 min) to decide whether to continue or pivot
3. Use [winding-down.md](resilience/winding-down.md) at the end of a deep session
4. Delegate tasks or reflections to assistants or tools

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/collab-frame.git
cd collab-frame

# Customize for your needs
cp about-me.md.template about-me.md
```

Example workflow:

1. Begin by updating your `about-me.md` with your preferences
2. Create a new plan in `plan-now.md` with your immediate goals
3. Work in focused intervals with regular checkpoints
4. Use the reflective routines when needed to maintain clarity

> The goal is not to follow a system perfectly, but to build trust in your ability to recover clarity, intention, and momentum.
